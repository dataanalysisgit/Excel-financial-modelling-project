# Excel-financial-modelling-project


A Simple financial modelling project to forecast the P&L and the balance sheet of the company with simple formulas and calculations

Some items of the balance sheet cannot be calculated in the table but seperate calculations have to be carried out to fill the balance sheet in the 
table as you will be able to see in the file.
Easy to understand once you have a look at the excel sheet and try to figure out the calculations and formulas involved.

formulas involved:
VLOOKUP
INDEX AND MATCH MATCH
OFFSET AND MATCH
COUNTIF
SUMIF
SUMIFS
COUNT

Calculations involved in forecasting p&l:
1. Revenue as % of growth
2. COGS as % of Revenue
3. Opex(Operating expenses) as  % of revenue

Calculations involved in forecasting balance sheet:
DSO (Days sales outstanding)  = trade receivables / revenue * 360 
DPO (Days payable outstanding) = trade payables / COGS * 360
DIO (Days inventory outstanding) = trade payables / COGS * 360
other assets % = other assets / revenue
other liabilities % = other Liabilities / revenue
